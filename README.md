# Ecommerce React App

This is a simple ecommerce item management app built with React and Vite.

## Features
- View and add items with details (name, type, description, price, images)
- Price field for each item
- Items are saved in browser localStorage (data persists after refresh)
- Modern styled Add Item form
- Routing between View Items and Add Item pages

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## How it works
- **Add Item:** Fill the form (including price) and submit to add a new item.
- **View Items:** See all items with their details and price.
- **Persistence:** Items are stored in localStorage, so they remain after page refresh.
